					<h1>RepRap - Electronics</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						I've been working for a while on building a 3D printer. I'm building de
						<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)">Prusa Mendel</a> from the RepRap
						project. When it come to the electronic you have a lot of options. But most of them are pretty similar. They
						have an ATmega microprocessor and Pololu stepper drivers. A already have an Arduino Uno which is based on an
						ATmega328, so I decided to base my electronic on this microprocessor. The problem is most RepRap electronic
						is based on an ATmega1284 or an ATmega2560. The main differences with the ATmega328 is that it is has less memory
						and less I/O pins. According to many people the memory part is not an issue. For the I/O pins what it means is
						that it probably won't support dual extrusion or a heat bed.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I based my electronic on the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS v1.4</a>, but I didn't kept
						their board layout.

					<h1>Temporary blog system</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						I started to create a publishing system based on node.js. It's a static site generator. But unlike most
						of the static site generator, it's intended to be used not only by geeks but by any Web publisher. It doesn't
						have a name yet, I call it web-writer for now. I'll make it public on GitHub as soon has I have something
						functional.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since I want a blog right now and the web-writer isn't ready yet, I just wrote this blog in plain HTML using
						<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter's Bootstrap</a> and hosted it using
						<a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. At the same time, I hope that starting to
						publish content myself will help me understand better what my publishing system should be.
					</p>
					<p>
						The blog code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/fgascon/fgascon.github.com">github.com/fgascon/fgascon.github.com</a>.
