					<h1>RepRap - Electronics</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						I've been working for a while on building a 3D printer. I'm building de
						<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)">Prusa Mendel</a> from the RepRap
						project. When it come to the electronic you have a lot of options. But most of them are pretty similar. They
						have an ATmega microprocessor and Pololu stepper drivers. A already have an Arduino Uno which is based on an
						ATmega328, so I decided to base my electronic on this microprocessor. The problem is most RepRap electronic
						is based on an ATmega1284 or an ATmega2560. The main differences with the ATmega328 is that it is has less memory
						and less I/O pins. According to many people the memory part is not an issue (depending on what firmware you use).
						For the I/O pins, what it means is that it probably won't support dual extrusion or a heat bed. But that won't
						be an issue either because my RepRap don't have neither of these right now.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I based my electronic on the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4">RAMPS v1.4</a>, but I didn't kept
						their board layout. I separated the board into 3 smaller boards. Two of them are for the motor drivers and the
						other one is for the heater and thermistor control. Making them in to separate board will allow me to expand the
						capacities by adding other boards. I can for example add a heater and thermistor board and a motor driver board
						to add a second extruder.
					</p>
					<p>
						I only made one the motor driver board so far. The second one will be identical to first one. Here is how it
						look right now.

						The board can control two stepper motors. It's missing some screw terminals for the motors and the second Pololu
						controler on the photo.

					<h1>Temporary blog system</h1>
				</header>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
						I started to create a publishing system based on node.js. It's a static site generator. But unlike most
						of the static site generator, it's intended to be used not only by geeks but by any Web publisher. It doesn't
						have a name yet, I call it web-writer for now. I'll make it public on GitHub as soon has I have something
						functional.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since I want a blog right now and the web-writer isn't ready yet, I just wrote this blog in plain HTML using
						<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter's Bootstrap</a> and hosted it using
						<a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. At the same time, I hope that starting to
						publish content myself will help me understand better what my publishing system should be.
					</p>

						The blog code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/fgascon/fgascon.github.com">github.com/fgascon/fgascon.github.com</a>.
